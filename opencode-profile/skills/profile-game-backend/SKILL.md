## Focus
- Optimize latency-sensitive and real-time interaction paths.
- Protect session state consistency under burst traffic.
- Design for live-ops: feature toggles, hotfix speed, and safe rollback.

## Decision lens
- Player experience and uptime first.
- Balance consistency with throughput and cost.
- Instrument for cheat detection, abuse patterns, and incident response.
