## Focus
- Maximize correctness, traceability, and auditability.
- Treat money movement and ledger consistency as critical paths.
- Prefer explicit validation, idempotency, and deterministic behavior.

## Decision lens
- Compliance and security before speed.
- Strong rollback and reconciliation planning.
- Minimize blast radius with staged rollout controls.
