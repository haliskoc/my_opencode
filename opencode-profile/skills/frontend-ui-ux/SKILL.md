## Mission
- Build visually intentional interfaces, not boilerplate UI.
- Match project conventions while improving hierarchy, rhythm, and interaction quality.
- Keep implementation production-grade and verified.

## Design direction
- Choose a clear tone (minimal, editorial, brutalist, playful, luxury, etc.).
- Commit to a cohesive palette and typography system.
- Prefer meaningful motion over scattered micro-animations.

## Guardrails
- Avoid generic visual defaults and repetitive templates.
- Avoid unnecessary scope expansion.
- Ensure desktop and mobile behavior are both validated.
